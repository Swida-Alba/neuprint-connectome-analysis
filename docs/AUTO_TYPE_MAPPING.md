# Auto Type Mapping for Cross-Dataset Comparison

## Overview

When comparing neuron connectivity profiles across different *Drosophila* connectome datasets (e.g., hemibrain vs male-cns, FAFB vs BANC), a fundamental challenge arises: **the same biological neuron types may have different names in different datasets**. 

For example:
- `lLN7` (hemibrain) = `ALIN4` (male-cns, flywire)
- `DNp01` (male-cns) = `DNp01` (flywire) = `DNp01` (hemibrain) ← same name, no issue
- `MTe07` (flywire) = `MeVPLo2` (male-cns)

The **Auto Type Mapping** feature automatically standardizes neuron type names across datasets, enabling meaningful cross-dataset comparisons of connectivity profiles.

## How It Works

### 1. Canonical Type Names

We use **male-cns** as the canonical reference dataset because:
- It represents a complete CNS reconstruction (unlike hemibrain's partial brain)
- It includes the most up-to-date neuron type annotations
- It has extensive type metadata including mappings to other datasets

The `CrossDatasetTypeMapper` class builds mappings from the male-cns `neuron_df`, which contains columns linking each neuron's type across datasets.

### 2. Type Mapping Source

The mapper uses the male-cns neuron DataFrame located at:
`datasets/male-cns_v1_0/male-cns_v1_0_allneurons_neuron_df.csv`

Key columns used:
- `type`: male-cns type name
- `flywireType`: corresponding FAFB v783 type (it is not a BANC bridge)
- `hemibrainType`: corresponding type in hemibrain
- `mancType`: corresponding type in MANC

These crosswalk columns may list several names in one cell, separated by
`,`; each name is used individually (a male-cns type pointing at several
flywire types becomes a 1-to-N conflict instead of a bogus joined name).

#### Mapping labels versus display labels

Crosswalk columns are used to resolve equivalent type names for search and
connectivity comparison. They do not replace the source dataset's native
`type` label in a transformed query visualization. For example, an MCNS row
with `type = SMP227` and `flywireType = CB1449,CB2843` is mapped through the
`flywireType` value for cross-dataset analysis, but the query overlay in a
target FAFB scene remains labeled `SMP227`.

#### Renamed FlyWire types (additional Type(S) columns)

FAFB and BANC releases publish release-specific additional-type columns that
record type renames between releases:

- FAFB v783: `additional_type(s)` in
  `datasets/flywire_FAFB_v783/flywire_FAFB_v783_allneurons_neuron_df.csv`
- BANC v626: `Alternative Cell Type(s)` in
  `datasets/banc_v626/banc_v626_allneurons_neuron_df.csv`
- BANC v888: `Alternative Cell Type(s)` in
  `datasets/banc_v888/banc_v888_allneurons_neuron_df.csv`

When a male-cns `flywireType` value is **no longer a primary `type`** in the
target dataset but appears in that column, the mapping resolves to the
current primary name. Example: male-cns `SLP249` has `flywireType = SLP249`,
but in FAFB v783 those neurons are typed `APDN3` and `SLP249` survives only
in `additional_type(s)` — so the auto mapping resolves
`male-cns SLP249 → FAFB APDN3`.

Resolution rules:

- The old name resolves to the **single** primary type listing it (rename).
- If **several** primary types list the old name (a split, e.g. FAFB
  `AOTU008` → `AOTU008a/b/c/d`), no automatic mapping is made and a
  `TypeMappingConflict` is recorded instead.
- Names that are already a primary type pass through unchanged.
- FAFB and BANC resolve independently: a name FAFB renamed may still be
  primary in BANC (e.g. `MDN` → `DNp50` in FAFB, still `MDN` in BANC), so
  each keeps its own mapping namespace.
- Missing dataset tables only disable the rename resolution; the mapper
  still works from the male-cns crosswalk alone.

#### Curated BANC label bridges

BANC v626 and v888 publish release-local, per-dataset labels. The mapper
reads these columns directly and treats them as the authoritative direct
bridge for the corresponding namespace:

| BANC column | target namespace | verification |
|---|---|---|
| `fafb_cell_type` | FAFB v783 | `fafb_match` when the FAFB table is available |
| `malecns_cell_type` | male-cns v1.0 | `malecns_match` when the MCNS table is available |
| `hemibrain_cell_type` | hemibrain v1.2.1 | curated label or known normalized `auto:` label |
| `manc_cell_type` | MANC v1.0/v1.2.1 | curated label or known normalized `auto:` label |

The labels are voted per BANC primary type. A single candidate, or a
candidate with more than half of the votes and at least twice the runner-up,
wins; unresolved splits become a `TypeMappingConflict`. A known match-bodyId
whose target `type` agrees or disagrees with a FAFB/MCNS label never changes
the vote itself: every row's candidate keeps its vote, and the observation
is recorded separately as `verified_votes` (match-bodyId found among the
row's candidates) or `verification_conflicts` (match-bodyId points at a
different type). Those tallies are diagnostics for confidence review — they
do not add or remove votes in the final decision. The
`auto:` prefix is provenance, not a separate type namespace: a normalized
`auto:<name>` token is eligible only when `<name>` resolves to a known target
type. The raw token and its auto evidence tier are retained in bridge
provenance and exports. Unknown `auto:` tokens, `Unknown`, empty labels, and
bare numeric sentinels remain ineligible. Conflicting votes remain rejected
even when one conflicting row uses a known `auto:` token. These bridges are
direct-only: BANC is not introduced as a connector between unrelated endpoint
pairs. A label hop is also a
**derivation endpoint**: once it lands in the target namespace, the chain
ends there — the label cell names the reached type exactly, and continuing
into that namespace's annotation graph would only drift onto unrelated
primaries (see the cross-reference rule below).

`fafb_alignment_cell_type` is retained for search/alignment metadata only; it
does not create a type bridge. `fanc_cell_type` is intentionally unlicensed
until a FANC namespace and evidence policy are added.

`Alternative Cell Type(s)` remains an intra-BANC annotation column. It is not
used as a substitute for the curated per-dataset label columns.

#### The FAFB ↔ BANC annotation bridge (additional Type(S) ⇄ Alternative Cell Type(s))

The two FlyWire annotation columns also work as a **direct bridge between
the FAFB and BANC namespaces**, without routing through the male-cns
crosswalk. A FAFB `additional_type(s)` token that also appears in a BANC
`Alternative Cell Type(s)` cell connects the types on both sides:

```
FAFB type --(additional_type(s))--> shared token --(Alternative Cell Type(s))--> BANC type
```

Example: FAFB `s-CPDN3A` rows annotate `CB1770`/`CB1791`/`SMP229`, which
are BANC primary types — the bridge derives all three candidates even
though no crosswalk row connects them. The derivation walk lands the
shared token in the other namespace (a dedicated hop) and continues over
that namespace's own annotation edges, so every chain carries the full
evidence (both annotation columns appear as linkers).

**Cross-reference rule (within one namespace)**: a primary type's
annotation cell that names *another primary of the same namespace* is a
cross-reference, not a rename — BANC's `Alternative Cell Type(s)`
concatenates the other datasets' curated labels, so such a token usually
describes how a neuron is called ELSEWHERE. The walk therefore never hops
from a primary to another primary via that primary's own annotation cell.
This closes the name-graph wander where one oddly-labeled neuron bridged a
circadian type (`l-LNv`) onto every primary sharing its `BM_InOm` label
(1,212 interommatidial bristle neurons) with zero supporting rows on the
reached types.

Production resolution applies the bridge as an overlay with this
precedence:

1. **Crosswalk route** (male-cns anchored) — wins when present.
2. **Same-name identity** — a type that is a primary in both namespaces
   maps to itself (e.g. FAFB `APDN3` → BANC `APDN3`). Without this, a
   same-name type absent from the crosswalk would resolve to nothing and
   vanish from cross-dataset queries.
3. **Annotation bridge** — exactly one candidate becomes the mapping;
   several candidates become a `1-to-N` conflict (never guessed),
   deduplicated against crosswalk conflicts.

Untyped sentinels (`Unknown`, empty, bare numbers) never become bridge
targets or candidates — consistent with the cross-dataset run's default
untyped-neuron drop.

The exports state how each pair was derived: `auto_type_mapping.csv`
carries a `mapping_origin` column (`crosswalk`, `same name`, or
`annotation bridge via <token>`); `auto_type_mapping_conflicts.csv`
carries an `origin` column with the same distinction. Bridge pairs whose
endpoints have no male-cns anchor get their own rows. Ambiguity
resolution by neuron counts is deliberately NOT applied — the conflicts
export is the place to adjudicate those by hand.

#### Valid bridge source map (BRIDGE_SOURCE_MAP)

Every derivation bridge the mapper offers is licensed by the declarative
`BRIDGE_SOURCE_MAP` constant in
`src/comparison/cross_dataset_type_mapper.py` — valid bridges are derived
from the source map, never guessed from the data layout. The map licenses
one edge per `(home dataset, name column) -> {landing datasets}`:

| home dataset | column | lands in |
|---|---|---|
| any | `type` | any namespace (same-name identity) |
| male-cns | `flywireType` | FAFB only |
| male-cns | `hemibrainType` | hemibrain only |
| male-cns | `mancType` | manc only (the crosswalk was built against MANC v1.0) |
| BANC v626/v888 | `fafb_cell_type` | FAFB only |
| BANC v626/v888 | `malecns_cell_type` | male-cns v1.0 only |
| BANC v626/v888 | `hemibrain_cell_type` | hemibrain only |
| BANC v626/v888 | `manc_cell_type` | MANC v1.0/v1.2.1 only |
| FAFB | `additional_type(s)` | FAFB only |
| BANC | `Alternative Cell Type(s)` | BANC only |
| BANC v626/v888 | `banc_release_crosswalk` | the other BANC release only; relation-backed when available, exact same-name fallback otherwise |
| MCNS v0.9/v1.0 | `release_alias` | same-name MCNS release alias only |

On top of the map, one endpoint rule applies: **a crosswalk hop is valid
only when the bridge's endpoints include a namespace the column routes
to**. A `hemibrainType` hop on a male-cns↔BANC bridge describes a third
dataset's naming and is rejected (e.g.
`DN1pA[MCNS·type] → DN1pA[MCNS·hemibrainType] → DN1pA[BANC·type]` is
invalid), while the sanctioned hemibrain↔flywire route through male-cns
(`hemibrain type → hemibrainType → male-cns type → flywireType → flywire
type`) is licensed on both legs. Chains whose standardized linkers contain
consecutive identical `(column, value)` pairs (zero-information ping-pong,
the additional_type(s)→additional_type(s) self-loop class) are also
rejected, and every chain must end at a real primary `type` of the target
dataset.

The map is verified against the data at load time and by
`tests/core/test_type_mapper_source_map.py`, which grounds the declared
columns in the actual dataset tables, sweeps every directed namespace pair
for licensing violations, and pins the known-pair regressions.  At load
time, a declared column missing from a table that IS present aborts the
load (data drift must not silently change what is bridgeable — the run
logs `BRIDGE_SOURCE_MAP: …` and the mapper stays unloaded); an absent
optional table (e.g. no FlyWire side table) only disables its bridges.

An interactive network visualization of the map (datasets, their name
columns, and the licensed edges) is regenerated with:

```bash
python scripts/render_source_map_network.py
# → outputs/type_mapping/source_map_network.html
```

#### The bridge-rule algebra, connectors, and preference order

The derivation walk is governed by a closed algebra — the full
implementation reference lives in
`docs/technical/AUTO_TYPE_MAPPING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. The rules:

- **Direct bridge forms** — the pair linkers above plus same-name
  identity everywhere.
- **Connectors** (`ROUTE_MIDS`): a derivation chain visits at most ONE
  intermediate namespace, and only a licensed one — male-cns connects the
  neuprint families through its own crosswalks. BANC label bridges are
  direct-only, and **BANC is never a connector**. MCNS↔BANC uses
  `malecns_cell_type`, never `flywireType`; every other unregistered pair is
  direct-only.
- **Bidirectional, no flips** — the reverse travel direction reverses
  the hop order (the SAME bridge, not a flip); a two-linker chain
  cannot reorder its linkers.
- **Evidence first, same-name LAST** — a same-name pair derives through
  its metadata bridge when one exists: male-cns `DN1a` rows'
  `flywireType` cell naming `DN1a` verifies FAFB `DN1a → DN1a` as
  `flywireType 'DN1a'` instead of the bare "same name — no metadata
  verification" echo. The same-name chain is the LAST choice, shown
  only when no evidence edge connects the pair.
- **Registry-less pairs stop at the arrival** — the post-arrival
  annotation continuation is a two-linker registry-standard privilege
  (male-cns↔FAFB etc.); BANC pairs cannot wander their annotation
  classes after landing.
- **Curated label / release / alias hops end the derivation** — when one
  of these linkers lands in the target namespace, nothing may follow it
  (the reached type's rows carry the evidence themselves); when it lands
  in a licensed intermediate (BANC `malecns_cell_type` → male-cns), only
  the licensed hub leg may continue, never an annotation hop.
- **Primary→annotation-primary hops are refused** — a primary's
  annotation cell naming another primary of the SAME namespace is a
  cross-reference (see above), not a rename edge; the derivation never
  hops through it.
- **Zero-evidence chains are dropped at pooling** — as a safety net, a
  chain whose target-side linkers all pool zero rows on the reached type
  never renders (its own coverage would read `0 of n`); the UI logs the
  drop instead of showing an unsupported derivation.
- **Untyped labels** (`Unknown`, empty, bare numbers) never become
  bridge nodes or targets.

#### Per-release namespaces (version control)

BANC v626 and BANC v888 are separate mapping namespaces, each resolving
against its OWN neuron tables — a `banc_v888` selection can never land
v626 names or pool v626 bodyIds. Both releases sit in the mapper's
`DATASET_PRIORITY` walk (v888 right after v626), so a v888-only type name
auto-detects its own namespace instead of falling through to "unknown". They have one narrow exception: the
metadata-backed `root_626`↔`root_888` relation provides a direct
`banc_release_crosswalk` type bridge. It retains duplicate `root_626` rows,
uses `root_888` (never `banc_888_id`), and never falls back to equal numeric
IDs. Generic BANC annotation/transitive paths remain forbidden.

`male-cns:v0.9` also keeps its native table and bodyId space. For a shared
primary name, the mapper emits `v0.9 type → release_alias → v1.0` and then
uses the v1.0 crosswalk for the requested target. A v0.9-only name never
borrows a fabricated v1.0 name; it can use its own `flywireType`,
`hemibrainType`, and `mancType` columns as a lower-tier fallback.

The dataset selector recommends `male-cns:v1.0` when v0.9 is selected. The
notice is advisory and explicit: it does not silently replace the selection,
and it is hidden when the newer release is already selected or unavailable
in the current options. The shared policy lives in
`src/utils/dataset_release_registry.py`; uncertified MANC release candidates
remain non-recommended.

The v0.9/v1.0 comparison is exposed in mapper diagnostics: the real local
tables have 176,379 common bodyIds, 11,597 shared primary names, 1,354
typed-row name disagreements, and a nested `release_alias_disagreement`
record for the 29 shared v0.9 names affecting 71 joined rows. These are audit
signals; they never substitute v1.0 bodyIds for a v0.9 query.

#### One shared backend (viewer ⇄ panel parity)

The 'See available neurons' mapped view and the cross-dataset tab's
Type Mapping panel resolve every type through the same
`mapped_type_targets()` backend (stored/alias resolution ∪
derivation-bridge ends) and count each mapped target's neurons ONCE —
both surfaces report identical target sets and unique neuron counts
(e.g. `circadian_clock`: 21 FAFB types / 242 neurons → 40 male-cns
targets / 219 unique neurons on both).

The Type Mapping panel's **Mapping graph (HTML)** preserves that provenance:
when a query resolves through a taxonomy column such as FAFB `cell_type`, the
query entry is owned by FAFB and connects only to its covered FAFB source
types. It is not duplicated as an entry node in each target dataset; target
summary counts remain separate from the query-entry population. The per-pair
**Network (type-level)** downloads follow the same rule: a taxonomy query
entry is keyed and drawn on the dataset where the query resolved, attached
only to that side's source types, and its hover counts the origin-side
population (unique source types and their neurons) — never the target-side
received neurons.

#### Bidirectional type coverage (the panel's tables)

The panel's per-pair **Type coverage** expansion shows two tables over the
same mapped pairs. Relationship cells follow the row subject's fan-out: a
forward row (queried type → several targets) and a backward row (receiving
type ← several sources) both read **1-to-N** — read the backward rows from
the receiving type back to its sources; a multi-source row never reads
`1-to-1`.

Backward rows marked **dataset-wide incoming** list every source type in
the source dataset that maps onto the receiving type (the active query
members marked in `Mapped from`), with the incoming family's selected- and
all-valid-union coverage — the context that explains why one queried type's
few neurons fan out to a large target population (e.g. MCNS `SMP227`: 6
neurons → 94 FAFB neurons across `s-CPDN3B/C/D`, whose incoming families
are 4/4/6 MCNS types). This context is explanatory evidence only; it never
changes which mappings the run accepts.

The four coverage columns carry short `CODE · selected` / `CODE · all
valid` labels; hover a header for the full dataset key and the scope
explanation: **selected** = the first supported bridge chain after
deterministic evidence ordering (the primary chain behind edge weights and
hovers, not a biological adjudication); **all-valid union** = the
deduplicated union of bodyIds from every independently supported candidate
bridge (completeness of supported evidence; branches are not mutually
exclusive). Neither column is a bodyId-to-bodyId correspondence.

## The two label lanes (explicit vs automatic)

DROCAT standardizes neuron type names through TWO independent lanes. They
never mix implicitly, and the explicit lane always wins:

1. **Explicit LabelMapper lane** — a user-provided `LabelMapper` (UI presets,
   custom mapping files) is applied at connection-extraction time: the
   connection builder writes `std_label_pre`/`std_label_post` and overwrites
   the raw `type` columns BEFORE results are cached (`LabelMapper.
   apply_to_dataframe`). Runs with an explicit mapper are compared under
   those labels; auto mapping does not second-guess them.
2. **Automatic mapper lane** — when no explicit mapper governs the run,
   `CrossDatasetTypeMapper` (male-cns v1.0 tables) resolves names through the
   shared validity resolver (`comparison/type_resolver.py`) at
   comparison/merge time: homolog candidates, path/edge canonical merge keys,
   profile expansion, query mapping, reports.

Shared conventions across both lanes: `label_utils.is_untyped_type_label`
is THE untyped-neuron predicate (pathfinding and comparison must agree on
what counts as untyped), and the auto lane's conflict/split/fallback policy
is the one documented in this guide (fail closed on conflicts; raw long-tail
fallback is counted, never silent).

### 3. User Warnings and Double-Check Recommendation

Auto type mapping is applied automatically, so runs surface what it changed
in two places — **please double check them before interpreting
cross-dataset results**:

1. **Console summary**: when source/target neurons are resolved, the run
   prints the auto-mapped names plus explicit `N-to-1` / `1-to-N` warnings,
   and ends with a reminder to double check the automatic mappings.
2. **`user_warning_notes.txt`** in the run folder root (rendered in the run
   guide's Warnings section). It is written when auto type mapping:
   - **expanded** a queried type name to a different name in a target
     dataset (e.g. `SLP249` → `APDN3` in FAFB, `MeVPLo2` → `MTe07`),
   - hit an **N-to-1** mapping (several types share one name across
     datasets — they are *not* merged to avoid wrong aggregation), or
   - hit a **1-to-N** mapping (a type splits into several names in the
     other dataset — no automatic mapping is made).

   Example:

   ```
   - Auto type mapping expanded queried type 'SLP249' to 'APDN3'
     (FlyWire FAFB v783); the queried name may not exist there.
   - N-to-1 type mapping: 'SLP249' is one of 4 types (CL125, PLP080,
     SLP249, SLP250) that all correspond to 'APDN3' in FlyWire FAFB v783;
     they were NOT merged to avoid wrong aggregation.
   - These name mappings were applied automatically - please double check
     them (against the datasets' type annotations or the exported mapping
     files) before interpreting cross-dataset results.
   ```

For cross-dataset comparisons the full applied mapping is additionally
exported to `auto_type_mapping.csv` (and conflicts to
`auto_type_mapping_conflicts.csv`) in the output folder.

3. **See available neurons viewer (expanded search)**: when a search finds
   no rows in the selected dataset, the viewer probes two expansions and
   shows a clearly separated panel:

   - **Type-name matches (native, mapper-free)**: the search text is
     matched as a case-insensitive substring against the `type` column and
     the taxonomy label columns (`class`/`cell_class`/`cell_type`/… ) of
     every other *cached* dataset's index. Matches are name-similar entries
     — **not necessarily the same type** — listed with neuron counts
     (exact matches first, then by count; capped per dataset). This tier
     works even when the auto type mapping knows nothing about the query.
   - **Auto type mapping** (the tier described above): renamed types,
     splits, and N-to-1 groups for the query name.

   Every matched foreign type is additionally annotated with what it is
   called in the selected dataset (unique rename, same name, or the members
   of a refused N-to-1 aggregation); types without a counterpart stay
   visible unannotated so the user is led to inspect them in the other
   dataset. Cross-dataset rows are informational only — they are never
   merged into the selected dataset's table or selection (bodyIds from
   different datasets must not be mixed) — and the panel repeats the
   double-check recommendation.

   Each dataset block also has a **"Mapped types"** button (the mapped type
   count is on its tooltip). It runs the equivalent search in the selected
   dataset: the main
   table switches to a *mapped-type view* listing the current dataset's
   neurons of the mapped type names, with a prominent warning banner
   ("automatic mapping — please double check") and a "Back to normal
   search" exit. Three provenance columns are appended per row: the
   **foreign type(s)** that mapped to it, the **map used column** (`type`,
   `additional_type(s) · via '<old name>'`, or the `flywireType`
   crosswalk), and the **matched column** that triggered the expansion
   (e.g. `cell_type · circadian_clock`). Because the view queries the
   *selected* dataset's index only, selection and add-to-query keep
   working normally; any new query leaves the mapped view and returns to
   the regular workflow.

### 4. Standardization Process

When comparing profiles from different datasets:

1. **Query type standardization**: Input type names are mapped to canonical names for profile retrieval
2. **Partner type standardization**: When computing similarity, the partner types in each profile are standardized to canonical names
3. **Similarity computation**: Jaccard, cosine, and rank correlation are computed on standardized partner type sets

### Disabling Auto Type Mapping

If you want to compare connectivity profiles without type name standardization (e.g., to see raw differences in naming conventions):

```python
# In ComparisonParameters
params = ComparisonParameters(
    datasets=['hemibrain:v1.2.1', 'male-cns:v0.9'],
    auto_type_mapping=False,  # Disable standardization
    # ...
)

# In ConnectivityProfileComparer
comparer = ConnectivityProfileComparer(
    query={'hemibrain:v1.2.1': [...], 'male-cns:v0.9': [...]},
    use_auto_type_mapping=False  # Disable standardization
)
```

## Implementation Details

### Partner Type Standardization

When computing connectivity profile similarity across datasets, the key insight is that **partner types** must also be standardized. For example:

**Profile A (hemibrain: ALIN4 → lLN7)**:
- Upstream: `PPL1-γ1pedc` (20%), `lLN7` (15%), `KC-γm` (10%), ...
- Downstream: `FB2B` (25%), ...

**Profile B (male-cns: ALIN4)**:
- Upstream: `PPL1-γ1pedc` (18%), `ALIN4` (16%), `KC-γm` (12%), ...
- Downstream: `FB2B` (22%), ...

Without standardization, `lLN7` and `ALIN4` would be treated as different types, reducing similarity. With standardization to male-cns names:

**Profile A (standardized)**:
- Upstream: `PPL1-γ1pedc` (20%), `ALIN4` (15%), `KC-γm` (10%), ...

**Profile B (standardized)**:
- Upstream: `PPL1-γ1pedc` (18%), `ALIN4` (16%), `KC-γm` (12%), ...

Now the Jaccard and cosine similarities correctly identify these as highly similar profiles.

### Supported Datasets

Type mappings are available for:
- `male-cns:v0.9` (canonical reference)
- `flywire_FAFB_v783`
- `banc_v626`
- `banc_v888`
- `hemibrain:v1.2.1`
- `manc:v1.0` / `manc:v1.2.1`

### Output Files

When running `ComparisonAnalyzer.export_results()` with `auto_type_mapping=True`, two files are generated:

1. **auto_type_mapping.csv**: Type mappings for neurons in results only
   ```csv
   male-cns:v0.9,flywire_FAFB_v783,banc_v626,hemibrain:v1.2.1,manc:v1.0,manc:v1.2.1
   ALIN4,ALIN4,ALIN4,lLN7,,
   DNp01,DNp01,DNp01,DNp01,,
   MeVPLo2,MTe07,MTe07,,,
   ...
   ```

2. **auto_type_mapping_conflicts.csv**: 1-to-N or N-to-1 mapping conflicts
   ```csv
   source_dataset,source_type,target_dataset,target_types,relationship
   male-cns:v0.9,WED092,flywire_FAFB_v783,"WED092b, WED092c, WED092d",1-to-N
   ```

### Conflict Handling

- **Unresolved 1-to-N mappings**: One source type has several target
  candidates. The candidates and licensed bridge chains remain available as
  explicitly labeled evidence, but `get_mapped_type()` returns no single
  canonical target and automatic mapped-neuron totals do not choose a branch.
  For example, MCNS `SMP227` → FAFB `s-CPDN3B`, `s-CPDN3C`, and
  `s-CPDN3D` is valid split evidence, not a single accepted mapping.
- **N-to-1 mappings**: Multiple source types share one target name. These
  types should NOT be aggregated incorrectly; coverage and artifacts retain
  their independent endpoint populations.
- **BANC label votes**: a unique winning vote may be accepted, including a
  known normalized `auto:` label, but a conflicting vote set stays rejected.
  For example, BANC `CB1011` remains unmapped toward MCNS despite its
  same-name row.

Use `mapper.get_mapping_conflicts(source_dataset, target_dataset,
source_type)` for a direction-scoped conflict, and
`mapper.is_n_to_1_type(type_name, dataset)` for the legacy broad check.

## Performance Considerations

- Type mapping lookups are O(1) hash table operations
- Mapping tables are loaded lazily on first use
- For large-scale batch comparisons, the mapper is passed once to avoid repeated loading
- Partner standardization adds minimal overhead (dict comprehension)

## Troubleshooting

### "Type mapper not loaded" warning

This means the neuron_df file wasn't found. Check:
1. File exists at `datasets/male-cns_v1_0/male-cns_v1_0_allneurons_neuron_df.csv`
   (the active default mapping source is male-cns **v1.0**; the retained
   `datasets/male-cns_v0_9/` table is auxiliary/legacy compatibility data,
   not the active source)
2. The workspace path is correctly configured

A failed load is observable and retryable: the mapper records the reason
on `last_load_error` (also reported by
`comparison.cross_dataset_type_mapper.get_type_mapper_state()`), and any
subsequent mapper call retries the load. Profile-comparison results carry
an `auto_type_mapping_*` metadata block in `parameters.json` (requested
vs active, source, version, load error, per-status resolution counts,
raw fallback flag) so a run that fell back to raw names can never be
mistaken for a valid-mapper run.

### Type not found in mapping

If a type has no cross-dataset mapping:
- The original type name is preserved (identity mapping); this long-tail
  fallback is counted in the result metadata (`raw_fallback_used` and the
  `unmapped` status counts)
- Types with a mapping CONFLICT (for example BANC `CB1011`) fail closed:
  they are excluded from automatic cross-dataset comparison and are never
  compared by raw same-name
- This is expected for types unique to one dataset

### Unexpected similarity scores

If cross-dataset similarity seems too low:
1. Check if key partner types have mappings
2. Consider that some connectivity differences are real biological variation
3. Use `use_auto_type_mapping=False` to see raw (unmapped) comparison

## Threshold equivalence across datasets

Standard mode compares all datasets at the SAME threshold (horizontal
comparison); Custom combination mode lets one named query use a different
requested threshold in each dataset. Synapse-count conventions differ strongly between datasets —
the median number of synapses per neuron spans ~6x (BANC v626 ≈ 52 post,
FAFB v783 ≈ 308 post, male-cns v1.0 ≈ 340 post / 490 pre+post) — so "BANC
≥ 3" and "FAFB ≥ 3" do NOT cut the connectomes at comparable sparsities.
This section gives a rough, whole-dataset alignment. The threshold-alignment
files are raw-run density diagnostics; use the query manifest for the actual
per-query comparison rows.

### Criterion

**bodyId-level per-neuron connection-pair density**: the number of distinct
(presynaptic, postsynaptic) body pairs with weight ≥ t, divided by the
dataset's total neuron count. Unweighted — edge presence only, synapse
counts (weights) ignored.

Caveats:

- BANC local downloads are pre-truncated at weight ≥ 3 (thresholds 1–2 are
  no-ops on the pair counts).
- male-cns numbers come from the ~98% coverage connection cache.
- Whole-dataset values are a rough hint only. Real matching is
  query-specific — a given query's best-aligned thresholds can differ from
  the global rule by several units (this is exactly why every run exports
  its own alignment).

### Reference values (whole dataset, pairs per neuron)

The dated, maintained reference table lives in the
[Cross-Dataset Comparison guide](./core-features/CrossDatasetComparison_Guide.md)
(re-baselined 2026-09-07 on the refreshed 2026-09-04 BANC bucket tables).
Use that table for the current values; the headline calibration is:

- **τ = 3**: BANC v626/v888 (46.8/46.1 pairs per neuron) are directly
  comparable with FAFB @3 (47.3); male-cns sits ≈ 1.3x BANC (≈ male-cns @5).
- **τ ≥ 5**: the classic multipliers re-emerge and grow with τ — FAFB ≈ 2x
  BANC at τ=5 rising to ≈ 2.7–2.8x at τ=10; male-cns ≈ 2.7x at τ=5 rising
  to ≈ 3.8–3.9x at τ=10 (BANC @5 ≈ FAFB @8 ≈ male-cns @8).
- The pre-refresh numbers (BANC 23.2/19.2 @3; "FAFB ≈ 2.2–2.3x BANC,
  male-cns ≈ 2.8–3x BANC at every threshold"; "BANC lowest at every
  threshold") described the 2026-08 downloads and **no longer hold** — the
  table refresh roughly doubled BANC's τ=3 density. Do not reuse them.

### Where the per-query alignment comes from

Every cross-dataset run exports threshold-alignment files (spec Feature C):

- `comparison_results/threshold_alignment_best_matches.csv` — a bisection
  prober over each dataset's lowest-threshold extract finds the
  best-matching density threshold in every other dataset
  (extended range, not limited to the typed thresholds). Primary metric:
  edge-count distance `|n_a − n_b| / max(n_a, n_b, 1)`; tolerance ≤ 0.10.
- `comparison_results/threshold_alignment_matrix.csv` (+ heatmap) —
  pairwise metrics over the typed thresholds only.
- `comparison_results/edge_density_per_threshold.csv` and
  `comparison_visualizations/edge_density_threshold_curves.png` — the
  density curves behind the matching (absolute + per-neuron).

### Threshold query modes

Thresholds are edited in **Core Parameters**, not in Advanced Settings.
Standard N-chip input creates same-threshold queries (for example, `N=3` is
run at 3 in every selected dataset). Custom combination mode instead
use a dataset-column table in which each row is one complete query, for
example `BANC=3, FAFB=7, male-cns=8`. Every selected dataset must have a cell;
the table is not an independent threshold schedule for each dataset.

The sorted union of advanced cell values is only the deduplicated raw-run
schedule. Query alignment and similarity keep the row identity and never
substitute a scalar union value. The stable query/dataset join is exported as
`comparison_results/threshold_combinations.csv` and mirrored in the
`queries` block of `effective_thresholds.json`, including requested/applied
threshold, StrongestFirst budget and tau, Edge Budget `w0`/`w1`, `w2`, `W*`,
and `paths_complete`.

### Related run features

- **Duplicate-threshold skipping (Feature G)**: with a path budget, a run
  whose weakest emitted path has bottleneck τ produces the identical set
  for every threshold up to τ; later input thresholds ≤ τ are skipped and
  marked `skipped/duplicate_of` in `threshold_sensitivity.csv` (τ collapse).
- **Replay paths (Feature F)**: in path mode 'all' the path set is
  enumerated once at the lowest threshold; every higher threshold is
  materialized from the bottleneck-annotated path set (identical outputs,
  no re-enumeration). Disable via Advanced Settings ▸ Replay Paths.
