"""Shared strongest-selection core (§6c of the report-fixes plan).

ONE canonical definition of "strongest" for everything that bounds or
ranks paths in DROCAT:

- a path's strength is its BOTTLENECK (the minimum edge weight along it);
- ranking is by descending bottleneck, with deterministic tie rules;
- a budget selects exactly ``{paths : bottleneck >= tau}`` (ties at tau
  fully drained), so a budgeted run at threshold t is *equivalent to a
  complete run at the raised threshold tau*.

Consumers:
- ``fast_graph_core.find_paths_strongest_first`` (enumeration);
- ``vispath.VisualizePath`` edge/path selection (display);
- ``coana`` prune/notes reporting (strongest-retained bottleneck).

Pure functions only — no graph-object or I/O dependencies — so the
enumeration and display layers can share it without coupling.
