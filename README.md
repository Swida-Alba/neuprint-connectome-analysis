# *Drosophila* Connectome Analysis Toolkit (DROCAT) v4.5.0

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Python 3.10–3.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10--3.11-3776AB.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

DROCAT is a Python toolkit for analyzing and visualizing connectome data from **all NeuPrint databases, FAFB, and standalone BANC releases** — type-based pathfinding, interactive network visualizations with neurotransmitter grouping, 3D neuron morphology rendering, cross-dataset comparison, and EM↔LM driver line mapping (NeuronBridge). Everything is available both through a web UI and as standalone scripts.

> [!TIP]
> 🤖 **Agent-assisted:** ask your AI agent to run the bundled
> [`drocat-install`](skills/drocat-install/SKILL.md) skill — it installs all
> dependencies, configures tokens, verifies the installation, and launches
> the web UI for you. Installing the project also installs the analysis skills,
> so the agent already has them afterward (no fetch is needed):
> [`drocat-usage`](skills/drocat-usage/SKILL.md) for tab-matched script analyses
> (a recipe for every analysis panel), and [`drocat-backend`](skills/drocat-backend/SKILL.md)
> for flexible composition of backend modules. New to agents? Start with the
> [agent-assisted install section](docs/INSTALLATION.md#5-agent-assisted-install).

## Key Features

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Dataset Support** | NeuPrint (hemibrain, male-cns, optic-lobe, manc) + FAFB + standalone BANC releases, inter-dataset analysis |
| **EM↔LM Mapping** | NeuronBridge integration for GAL4/Split-GAL4 driver line discovery |
| **Visualization** | 3D skeletons, interactive networks, Sankey diagrams, heatmaps |
| **Similarity Tabs** | Connectivity (find similar + comparison, cross-dataset capable) and Morphology (find similar, intra-dataset) with connectivity-expanded candidates, ROI filtering, full-morphology downloads. Morphology similarity/comparison work on cached-skeleton datasets; for BANC they are deferred pending skeleton vector-quality validation (BANC 3D visualization and pathfinding are supported) |
| **Analysis** | Multi-hop pathfinding, cross-dataset comparison, hemisphere-aware analysis |
| **Performance** | Substantially faster repeat queries through local caching and Polars acceleration (local releases avoid the network round-trips of API-backed access) |

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** conda (auto-installed if missing) and internet access on first run.

**Option 1 — One-click install & launch.** After cloning the repository, launch DROCAT with the bundled launcher:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | double-click `mac_DROCAT.command` |
| Linux | run `./mac_DROCAT.command` in a terminal |
| Windows | double-click `windows_DROCAT.bat` |

On first run it creates the versioned `drocat-4.5.0` Python 3.11 environment (via the bundled installer in `archive/install/`; Python 3.10–3.11 is supported), installs the pinned dependencies, runs `pip check`, verifies the installation, and opens the web UI at **http://127.0.0.1:8080**. Later runs are self-healing: a missing or inconsistent environment is repaired automatically before starting. If the port is busy, the launcher offers a new one interactively.

**Option 2 — Agent-assisted install.** Copy the following prompt to your AI agent and let it finish cloning the repo, installing, verifying, and launching DROCAT:

> Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swida-Alba/Drosophila-cross-dataset-connectome-analysis/v4.5.0/skills/drocat-install/SKILL.md and follow it to finish cloning the repo, installing, verifying, and launching DROCAT on this machine.

For script analysis without the UI, the agent uses the checked-in analysis skills
(with the UI closed): [`drocat-usage`](skills/drocat-usage/SKILL.md) for
one-tab analyses and [`drocat-backend`](skills/drocat-backend/SKILL.md) for
flexible backend composition. They are part of the repository, so an installed
agent has them — no fetch is required.

**Manual launch** (after installation) — double-click `mac_DROCAT.command` (macOS / Linux) or `windows_DROCAT.bat` (Windows), or from a terminal:

```bash
conda activate drocat-4.5.0 && python ui/app.py
```

Every UI panel links to its own instruction guide (see [docs/ui_guides/README.html](docs/ui_guides/README.html)).

## Supported Datasets

All NeuPrint server datasets are supported (verified against `api.neuprint.janelia.org`), plus the FAFB and standalone BANC local releases. NeuPrint datasets are fetched automatically; FAFB uses local Codex files and optional CAVE access, while BANC uses its public release bucket with no CAVE token (see the Settings tab).

<details>
<summary><b>NeuPrint (11 datasets)</b> — male-cns, hemibrain, optic-lobe, manc, fib19, mushroombody</summary>

| Dataset | Description (from NeuPrint server) |
| --- | --- |
| `male-cns:v1.0` | Complete MaleCNS connectome (Janelia FlyEM + Cambridge) — latest |
| `male-cns:v0.9` | Complete MaleCNS connectome |
| `hemibrain:v1.2.1` | Adult female brain reconstruction (central complex + surrounding neuropils) |
| `hemibrain:v1.1` | Older hemibrain release |
| `optic-lobe:v1.1` | Drosophila optic lobe (right lobe, ~50k neurons, subset of MaleCNS) |
| `optic-lobe:v1.0.1` | Fly optic lobe reconstruction (~50k neurons) |
| `manc:v1.2.3` | MANC connectome — latest |
| `manc:v1.2.1` | MANC connectome |
| `manc:v1.0` | MANC connectome (original) |
| `fib19:v1.0` | Partial reconstruction of the fly medulla / lobula / lobula plate |
| `mushroombody` | Fly alpha lobe in the mushroom body (983 neurons) |

</details>

### FAFB + standalone BANC local releases (3)

| Dataset | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `flywire_FAFB_v783` | Female Adult Fly Brain (FAFB v783, 139,255 neurons) |
| `banc_v888` | Brain and Nerve Cord (BANC v888; standalone public-bucket tables + skeletons) |
| `banc_v626` | Brain and Nerve Cord, older (BANC v626; standalone public-bucket tables + skeletons) |

> BANC (Brain And Nerve Cord) is a standalone source analyzed from its own public release bucket as `banc_v888`/`banc_v626` — neuron metadata and connections prepare automatically (~134 MB once, no login or CAVE token), and 3D skeletons are fetched on demand and cached, so no bulk skeleton download is required. The NeuPrint server metadata also lists a hidden `banc:v888` entry, but it is not queryable through the NeuPrint API; the supported BANC path is the standalone local release above, not the NeuPrint-backed one.

## What's New in v4.5.0

- **Script-first analysis with coding agents** — run pathfinding, comparison, NeuronBridge, FlyLight, homolog, profile, PlotPath, and 3D skeleton scripts without the UI, via the [`drocat-usage`](skills/drocat-usage/SKILL.md) skill and its `run_direct.py` launcher.
- **Local FAFB + standalone BANC dataset support** — local-first FAFB caching and public-bucket BANC caching so repeated local-release queries avoid network round-trips entirely; Polars-backed matrix/CSV steps measured 10-100x faster in the [December 2025 benchmarks](docs/technical/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS_DEC2025.md) ([FAFB Integration](docs/FAFB_INTEGRATION.md), [BANC Integration](docs/BANC_INTEGRATION.md)).
- **NT visualization & grouping** — neurotransmitter edge groups, custom groups, export/import ([Network Features](docs/visualizations/VisualizePath_Network_Features.md)).
- **Similarity tab reorganization** — the Similarity group is now two main tabs, each with Find Similar / Comparison sub-tabs:
    - **Connectivity**: find similar is a homolog search across datasets (or within one dataset via Target = Source); comparison is multi-dataset connectivity profiling.
    - **Morphology**: find similar is an intra-dataset vector/NBLAST search; comparison is an intra-dataset N×N morphology comparison with type-level and bodyId-level matrices, heatmaps, and a report (`vector_v2` or NBLAST scoring, capped at 30 neurons).
    - The old "Connectivity similarity" mode is folded into Find Similar (it was intra-dataset homolog finding under another name); see the [Connectivity](docs/ui_guides/connectivity.html), [Morphology](docs/ui_guides/morphology.html), and [Comparison](docs/ui_guides/morphology_comparison.html) guides for connectivity-expanded candidates, ROI filtering, dual result tables, and the resumable full-morphology download.
- **Palette editor** — drag-and-drop reordering of discrete palette colors, a range slider applied directly to the displayed palette, a reset button beside the preview, and lateral range labels.
- **3D Skeleton reorganization** — independent card blocks for general appearance, neuron colors, synapse colors, and brain-region ROIs, with hemisphere-aware options.

## Releases

DROCAT ships one versioned branch per release (`v4.5.0`, `v4.4.5`, …), each mirrored as a Git tag and a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Swida-Alba/Drosophila-cross-dataset-connectome-analysis/releases). The default branch tracks the current release, and every release pins its own conda environment name (`drocat-<version>`), so multiple versions can coexist on one machine.
