"""
DROCAT exported run user guide.

After every successful UI run, a ``_UserGuide_please_read_me`` file is
written into the run's output folder. It describes every file in the run
folder, every column of the exported tables (via a shared, score/metric
directed column glossary), and renders the run's ``user_warning_notes.txt``
content when present.

One content model (``TOOL_GUIDE_SPECS`` + ``COLUMN_GLOSSARY``) drives three
renderers (HTML, Markdown, plain text), so the descriptions never diverge
between formats. The format is configurable in Settings → Default Settings
("Run Guide Format"): ``html`` (default), ``txt``, ``markdown`` or
``disabled``. The ``DROCAT_RUN_GUIDE_FORMAT`` environment variable overrides
the setting (used by tests and scripts for determinism).
