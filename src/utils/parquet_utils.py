"""Lossless Parquet re-encoding for the stored synapse tables.

The synapse tables are the largest files DROCAT keeps on disk.  Their
storage layout can be improved without touching a single value: Parquet
encodings (DELTA_BINARY_PACKED, BYTE_STREAM_SPLIT, DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY)
and conservative dtype narrowing are decoded transparently by every
reader, so a streaming rewrite that applies them is a pure byte reclaim.

``reencode_parquet_lossless`` applies a caller-supplied profile in one
streaming pass (optionally dropping dead columns at the same time), with
every narrowing decision guarded by footer statistics so a cast is only
taken when the data provably fits.  The rewrite goes to a temporary
sibling file and atomically replaces the original only after the complete
copy exists and its footer verifies, so an interrupted run never damages
the source; a footer key-value marker makes the pass idempotent.

The atomic write is centralized in ``write_parquet_atomic`` (write temp →
fsync → ``os.replace`` → fsync the directory) so every caller shares one
implementation, and stale temps are reclaimed only when their writer is
provably gone or the file is older than a grace period — a concurrent
preparation never has its in-progress temp deleted.
